#  Machine Learning (ML)
# Definition:
# Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

# Types of ML:

# Supervised Learning

# Unsupervised Learning

# Semi-Supervised Learning (optional)

# Reinforcement Learning (optional)

#  Supervised Learning
# Labeled data is used (input + correct output).

# The model learns from examples.

# Used for prediction, classification, etc.

# Examples:

# Regression (predict values)

# Classification (predict categories)

#  Unsupervised Learning
# Unlabeled data (only input, no output).

# Finds patterns, groups, or structures in data.

# Examples:

# Clustering (grouping)

# Dimensionality Reduction

#  REGRESSION TYPES
# 1️ Simple Linear Regression (SLR)
# Definition: Predicts a target variable using one independent variable.



# Example: Predicting house price based on area.

# 2️⃣ Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
# Definition: Predicts a target variable using two or more independent variables.

#
 
# Example: Predicting marks based on hours studied, sleep, and attendance.

# 3️⃣ Polynomial Linear Regression (PLR)
# Definition: A form of regression where the relationship between variables is modeled as an nth degree polynomial.


 

 
# Use: When data shows a curved trend rather than a straight line.

# Example: Predicting salary based on experience, when growth is non-linear.

# Summary Table:
# Type	Input          Features	Output	        Curve/Line	Use Case
# SLR	1	                 1	                Straight	Simple predictions (e.g., price vs area)
# MLR	2 or more	         1	                Straigh     Predicting with multiple factors
# PLR	1 (but polynomial)	 1	                Curve	    Non-linear trends
